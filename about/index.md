I am a 30 year old developer in Tampa, FL. Worked on many projects inside and outside of my day job. 

I build web applications for a various assortment of companies and activites. I specialize in PHP and Node.JS backend and front-end development. Integrating multiple software applications into a single cohesive product is what I do best. 	

# Projects:


##Kerio
Developed and maintain the [KerioCP](http://www.keriocp.com) WHMCS provisioning and add-on module. 
This includes an internal/private module used for monitoring the Kerio Connect user license counts to bill customers approrpriately based off user and storage usage.


##Ahsay Backup Software
Developed the control panel for resellers to be able to manage their own backup company with a white-labeled backup management dashboard under my currently employer [XZ Backup](http://www.xzbackup.com).  This includes all the backend services for allowing users to brand the interface and software, as well as keeping backup statistics up to date with alerting and monitoring. As well as building a module for WHMCS that integrates with the XZ Backup product directly, we have also open sourced a module for WHMCS [AhsayWHMCS](http://xzbackup.github.io/AhsayWHMCS/) for provisioning users to the Ahsay OBS servers for other users of Ahsay to use.


##node.js
Building microservices for monitoring, gathering, scraping, and manipulating data is my hobby.
