##ceph monitoring dashboard

###[Blessed Ceph Dashboard](https://github.com/digitallyserviced/blessed-ceph-dash)

Using the blessed-contrib library for building console dashboards in node.js, I built a dashboard to monitor our Ceph cluster using the console.

##blessed-contrib widgets

###[blessed-contrib](https://github.com/digitallyserviced/blessed-contrib)

To make the Ceph dashboard possible I had to add additional widgets to the mix. This included a **stacked guage** which provides a sort of combined progress bar. It also includes a **LCD display** widget for displaying basic text and numbers for showing stats in the dashboard.
